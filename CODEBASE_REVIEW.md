# SSHTrust Codebase Review

## Current State Summary

**Branch:** ACLs (3 commits ahead of main)  
**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Builds successfully  
**Test Status:** ‚úÖ All tests pass (8 test files, 33 total Go files)

## Architecture Assessment

**Structure:** Well-organized Go project with clear separation of concerns:
- CLI layer (cmd/) using Cobra framework
- HTTP server (internal/server/) using Echo framework  
- Core business logic (pkg/) with interfaces for extensibility
- Good test coverage across key components

**Code Quality:** Generally solid with some areas for improvement:
- Clean interfaces (CAStore, UserList) enabling dependency injection
- Proper concurrency handling with sync.RWMutex in memory store
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Some minor typos in struct names (`InMemortCaStore`)

## Test Coverage Analysis

**Coverage:** 24% (8/33 files have tests)
- ‚úÖ Core packages well-tested: cert, certStore, handlers
- ‚úÖ Integration tests via launch-server.sh
- ‚ùå Missing: cmd/ package tests, auth package tests

## Security Review

**Critical Issues:**
- üî¥ Hardcoded JWT secret: `auth.JWTSecret = []byte("secret")` (internal/server/main.go:32)
- üî¥ No password salting mentioned in TODO (internal/server/main.go:29)
- üî¥ JWT tokens valid for 72 hours (pkg/auth/user.go:71)

**Good Practices:**
- ‚úÖ bcrypt password hashing
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication 
- ‚úÖ Optional no-auth mode for development
- ‚úÖ Proper mutex usage for concurrent access

## ACL Implementation Status

**Current Progress:** Very early stage
- ‚úÖ Basic ACL struct defined (pkg/auth/acl.go)
- ‚úÖ Example ACL rules with wildcard and specific CA permissions
- ‚ùå No integration with actual authorization logic
- ‚ùå No user/group resolution system
- ‚ùå No enforcement in handlers or middleware

## Key Issues Identified

**High Priority:**
1. **Security:** Replace hardcoded JWT secret with environment variable
2. **Dockerfile:** Broken - switched from Ubuntu to Rocky Linux but kept apt-get commands
3. **ACL Implementation:** Placeholder code not connected to authorization flow

**Medium Priority:**
1. Typo in `InMemortCaStore` (should be `InMemoryCAStore`)
2. Missing tests for auth and cmd packages
3. No configuration management system
4. JWT token expiry too long for production

**Low Priority:**
1. Some inconsistent error messages
2. TODO comments need addressing
3. No graceful shutdown handling in server

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Fix security issues (JWT secret, Dockerfile)
2. **Next:** Complete ACL implementation with proper middleware integration
3. **Future:** Add configuration management, improve test coverage

## Conclusion

The codebase is in a solid foundational state with good architecture, but needs security hardening and completion of the ACL feature before production use.
